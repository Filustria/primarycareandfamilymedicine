["intro.html", "Introduction Summary and Objectives Methodology Databases Population study and Exposure Description of the three articles References", " Introduction Summary and Objectives This is a longitudinal retrospective study with the main objective of measuring the impact and the cost-effectiveness of vocational training in Family Medicine as part of the capacity building policy for Primary Health Care (PHC) implemented in 2012 during the PHC reform that happened between 2009 to 2016 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Since 1994[1] Brazil has been experiencing a big reform in PHC and today almost 70% of the Brazilian population is covered by the Programa Saúde da Família (PSF - Family Health Program). This Federal policy stablishes a structure for PHC at the municipal level, providing financial resources for a Family Health Team (ESF - Equipe de Saúde da Família) formed by one Physician, one Nurse and 4 to 6 Community Health Agents to take care of 4000 people living inside a catchment area. Rio de Janeiro was the last Brazilian capital to embrace the PSF. A PHC reform took place in the city between 2008 and 2016 and during this period the coverage increased from only 3.5% to 70%. 1400 Family Health Teams are currently working in the city, providing care for more than 3.5 million people in a system that merges public funding with private non-for-profit organizations responsible for management, care delivery and for structural and human resources. In 2012 the Health Department started a strategy for human resources capacity building in Family Medicine signing a partnership with the two Family Medicine residency programs stablished at that time in the city and also launching a new residency program. The strategy not only expanded the number of residency vacancies (210 vacancies in 2018) in Family Medicine (FM), but also included a financial incentive for both preceptors and residents, making FM more attractive to doctors seeking a specialization. This strategy aimed not only at capacity building of human resources, but also at provision and fixation of doctors in Primary Care Clinics in Rio de Janeiro. Despite the recent efforts of the Rio de Janeiro health department to make Primary Care more effective – establishing new clinics, improving working conditions and training new specialists – they were not enough to change policy makers mindset about the importance of PC and the need for professional training. Common generalizations still prevail among them, perpetuating wrong notions such as no need for specific training, other than medical graduation, to work in PC. This initiative ended up creating a natural experiment in the city. Some clinics now have only Family Physicians as medical health care providers, some have different combinations of trained Family Physicians and generalists and some have no trained doctors at all. In this scenario, there is a clear difference in access to health care and in the way patients are treated that is due to the amount of training received. These differences weren’t measured until now and “what is the actual difference?” – i.e., the real effect that having specific medical training focused on PC – it is an important question to be addressed, especially for countries with young PHC systems. The main objective of this thesis is to assess the impact on health outcomes of Family Medicine training provided by residency programs and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the investment made. Methodology Databases This research is composed by a cohort of patients registered and attended at the PHC clinics in the Rio de Janeiro municipality. The study will use data from (1) the electronic medical records (EMR) to conform the study population between the years 2010 and 2018, (2) data from the National Registry of Health Establishments (CNES) between the years 2010 and 2018, (3) data from the Mortality Information System (SIM) between 2000 and 2018, (4) data on referrals requested for patients to Secondary Care between 2010 and 2018 (SISREG platform); and (5) data from the Hospital Admissions National System (SISAIH) between 2008 and 2018, which compiles the information on hospital admissions through the registration of the Hospital Admission Authorizations (AIH). These five databases will be merged using a linkage process via with RecordLinkage and fastLink packages in R. Population study and Exposure The reference population for this study will be composed of the patients enrolled in the Primary Care clinics. Patients who have consulted in this period, but who are not registered in the health units will also be counted as the base population. The exposures of interest in the study are the medical professionals providing care to this population, representing different levels of training, i.e., (1) Generalists providing PC, with no special training; (2) generalists linked to the “Programa Mais Médicos” (PMM), a Federal policy for provision and fixation of doctors in remote areas; (3) trained Family Physicians; (4) Preceptors in Family Medicine; and (5) Residents in Family Medicine. Each of these five groups of professionals is linked to the service under a different employment regime, receiving different salaries, from different paying sources and with different financial incentives, conforming five different forms of medical work in PHC. These characteristics can be seen in the table below: Profissional Salary Bonus Funding source Workload (hours/week) Continuing Medical Education Generalist R$ 15.000,00 + taxes no bonus Public funded, managed by private non-for-profit institution 40 Seldom, addresing PH needs PMM R$ 10.000,00 (schoolarship) no bonus Federal government 32 Once a month by a FP FM resident R$ 3.300,00 (federal schoolarship)“ R$ 7.594,32 (municipal schoolarship) Federal &amp; Municipal entities 55 intensive Family Physician R$ 15.000,00 + taxes R$ 2.500 for trained FP Public funded, managed by private non-for-profit institution 40 Seldom, addresing PHC needs Preceptor in Family Medicine R$ 15.000,00 + taxes R$ 2.500 (trained FP) + R$ 2500 (preceptorship) Public funded, managed by private non-for-profit institution 40 intensive The five groups will be summarized into two main categories - Family Physicians (FP) and non-Family Physicians (generalists) and every Family Health Care Team (ESF) will be assigned as having one of the two categories. The original division is necessary to compute the cost-effectiveness analysis that will be held later. The outcomes that will be studied will result in three different articles, each of them addressing a distinct FMdomain of practice. Description of the three articles Ambulatory-Care Sensitive Conditions Longitudinal analysis through a Panel Data study, comparing FP to generalists for the measurement of outcomes related to the Brazilian list of Ambulatory-Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) [2]. This list comprises 20 domains covering infectious conditions (pneumonia and bacterial infections), chronic health problems (angina, heart failure) and preventive health care procedures (prenatal care), providing a good framework to approach the FM broad scope of practice. Rates of hospital admissions, referrals to secondary care, drugs prescribed, and laboratory exams ordered will be measured for every ESF. The Incidence Rate Ratio will be calculated between the two categories, estimating the interventions avoided (hospital admissions, referrals, drugs prescription and labs ordered) and, finally, the expenses avoided by FP in comparison to generalists. The unit of analysis will be the rate of each intervention by every ESF to those patients attended for ACSC. For the Economic Analysis, this study will measure the cost for avoiding the interventions mentioned above for those patients attended for ACSC. Comprehensive care for patients with multimorbidity Survival analysis of patients with Multimorbidity treated by FP versus generalists. Multimorbidity, defined as the occurrence of two or more chronic conditions in the same patient, will be measured for every patient attended at the PC clinics and time to event will be measured from the moment the patient fits the definition of Multimorbidity to the occurrence of two outcomes: death from any cause and first hospital admission. A longitudinal analysis using a Cox regression model to estimate the survival of multimorbid patients followed in Rio de Janeiro’s Primary Care, comparing patients treated by FP to generalists. The Charlson Index for comorbidity will be used to adjust the model, allowing patients with different burden of diseases to be compared. A Cost-effectiveness analysis will measure DALYs averted among multimorbid patients treated by FP compared to generalists. Survival of patients at cardiovascular risk Survival analysis comparing trained FP to generalists when dealing with patients at risk for cardiovascular outcomes. Patients older than 55 years-old with a cardiovascular risk greater than 10% in 10 years, according to the Framingham score, will be included in the study and time to event will be measured. A longitudinal analysis using a Cox regression model to estimate the survival for those patients treated at the Rio de Janeiro’s PHC System, comparing patients treated by FP to generalists. Individual cardiovascular risk will be used to adjust the model the same way the Charlson Index for comorbidity, allowing comparisons between patients with different burden of diseases. The events of interest are the main outcomes related to cardiovascular morbimortality, i.e., myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, coronary revascularization, claudication, and CHD and non-CHD mortality. A Cost-effectiveness analysis will measure DALYs averted among patients treated by treated by FP compared to generalists. References References "],

The diseases were selected from the Charlson [3] and Elixhauser [4] Comorbidities indexes since they are the two main indexes studied in the literature related to in-patient deaths. Each index has its own set of conditions and weights. The sets of conditions were taken from the orginial articles [3,4] where they were first published and from the Comorbidity R package article [5], where the author uses the same set of ICD-10 codes to build the indexes. Each chronic condition will be presented here with its prevalence in the population studied and stratified by age and sex. The DT library will be used to present the data and at the end of this chapter information about Multimorbidity is presented. Population description In this study only patients that have had at least one medical consultation during the period studied were counted.

Therefore, it is more likely that PC doctors miss to code this conditions in the patient’s EMR.

["blood-tests-ordered-in-primary-care-in-rio-de-janeiro.html", "Blood tests ordered in Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro HEMOGRAM CREATININE UREA URIC ACID The Cholesterol Combo Glicose and A1C Hemoglobin URINE ANALYSIS The Thyroid Combo - TSH, T4, T4 and Free - T4 PSA for Prostate Cancer Screening", " Blood tests ordered in Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro This analysis aims to identify patterns of physicians clinical behaviour regarding some blood test commonly ordered by doctors dealing with ambulatory patients in Primary Care. The period of analysis comprises every medical consultation in ambulatory care from January 1st, 2013 to November 1st, 2018 made by every doctors that work (or worked) in one of the 30 Primary Care Clinics at the ‘AP 31’ district in Rio de Janeiro. The total number of consultations was 2.967.694 during the period of analysis, that is the same period of the inclusion of the Eletronic Medical Records in the city. The total number of doctors that worked in the area is 952: 208 (21.8%) of them trained Family Physicians or residents in Family Medicine and 744 (78.2%) doctors with no special training for Primary Care, some of them with training in another residency (Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, OB/GYN). These doctors will be called ‘Generalists’ in this report. The rates were calculated for every doctor by dividing the number of each test ordered by the number of consultations made during a month. For comparison, the average rate was calculated for Family Physicians and Generalists. The blood tests chose for the sake of comparison are very common laboratory exams ordered in Primary Care and are sensitive for interventions aiming best practices in ambulatory care and special training in Family Medicine. The rationale for this study is that financial and institutional investments made in the last years to promote Family Medicine as the medical specialty for Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro should show some results such as better health outcomes, better care delivered for the patients and better use of healh resources available. In this study we will focus on blood tests as a resource that must be rationaly used by the health care provider and the hypothesis is that Family Physicians, due to their special training, order less blood tests then Generalists. HEMOGRAM One of the most commonly ordered tests in Primary Care (PC). Physicians tend to order it if they need to order any other blood test, even if no information is required from this exam. ## Warning: Detecting old grouped_df format, replacing `vars` attribute by ## `groups` CREATININE Blood test commonly ordered for patients with suspition of Renal Failure and for patients at risk for cardiovascular events, such as those with Hypertension and Diabetes. UREA Blood test commonly ordered for hospitalized patients and for those with Renal Failure as a secondary test to identify the origin of the renal disease. For patients in PC two conditions are likely to have this test ordered: Renal Failure and Heart Failure - two conditions not so prevalent in PC. For patients with Hypertension and Diabetes this test add no help to their treatment. URIC ACID This blood test is specific for patients with (or suspition of) gout arthritis. Due to the fact that patients with end-stage kidney disease have a higher risk of death when their Uric Acid levels are high, some doctors use to order this test for every patient at risk for cardiovascular disease, even if it is not helpful for patients with no renal demage. The Cholesterol Combo This combo is usualy ordered for patients at risk for cardiovascular events. Since the advent of cholesterol as one of the main responsible for heart attack and stroke, it is offered for almost every patient older than 45. All graphs but LDL Cholesterol show no difference between Family Physicians and Generalist. This only difference show that Family Physicians are more familiar with the formula used by the laboratories to calculate the LDL share of the Total Cholesterol. With this simple formula is posible to order only three test (Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol and Triglycerids) to find the value for LDL Cholesterol. Glicose and A1C Hemoglobin This tests are among the most ordered exams in Primary Care. They usually are ordered for two reasons related to Diabetes and glucose metabolism problems. Glucose is the first exam ordered to diagnose Diabetes - two tests higher than 126 mg/dL makes the diagnosis. After a patient is diagnosed with Diabetes the condition is managed with hypoglicemic measures (diet, weight loss, exercises and some medications) and the patients A1C hemoglobin must be checked every 6 months - in some cases doctors can do it in a shorter lag. In the glucose graph pregnant woman must be taken from the analysis, since this test is part of the pre-natal care protocol. URINE ANALYSIS The Thyroid Combo - TSH, T4, T4 and Free - T4 Thyroid problems are commom problems in Primary Care, especially Hypothiroidsm, which affects *** patients. Three problems occur with this tests. The first one is the “combo” issue. During graduation young doctors usually learn that, when it is needed to investigate any Thyroid gland problem, it must be done by ordering the full “combo” of exams. For the most common thyroid problems though, TSH provides enough information about the gland. The second problem is the “follow up” issue. Patients with Hypothyroidism (the most frequent thyroid disease) have lower levels of THS and need to take medications for hormone replacement. At the time of the diagnosis TSH levels are usually high (that makes the diagnosis) and with the hormonal replacement those levels must come back to the normal range (0.4 - 4 mg/dL). Therefore, there must be a dose adjustment by checking the TSH levels after some weeks of treatment. At this moment, the “combo” is ordered and three useless tests are performed. The third problem is related to clinical reasoning skills to deal with patients with undiferentiated symptoms in Primary Care and it explains the differences between the rates. During graduation medical students learn that thyroid gland problems can produce a vast and vague spectrum of symptoms. During the Family Medicine training doctors learn comunication skills and patient centered clinical methods that help them to solve some of this diagnostic challenges, avoiding unnecessary TSH tests. With no special training it is hard to approach patients ideas, concerns and expectations about their illness and easily a generalist will follow the line learnt at medical school: “If you don’t know what your patient has, check the thyroid gland”. In the T3, T4 and Free-T4 graphs what is shown is not a behavioural change among generalist, but a prohibition from the Municipal Department of Health for Primary Care physicians to order this tests without consent from the medical director of the clinic. Even with this vertical intervention, Family Physicians still order less PSA than their generalists colleagues. PSA for Prostate Cancer Screening Prostate Cancer Screening is a big public health and political issue. Media and medical specialties insist on calling adult men to perform this test as an anual “check-up”, advising them that this “frequent” cancer is treatable and deaths by prostate cancer are avoidable. Public health experts and evidence based physicians advocate against this test, telling men to avoid it, showing the consequences of overdiagnosis. Family Medicine is one of the medical specialties concerned with having good evidence to offer any procedure for their patients. In the graph what is shown is not a behavioural change among generalist, but a prohibition from the Municipal Department of Health for Primary Care physicians to order this tests without consent from the medical director of the clinic. Even with this vertical intervention, Family Physicians still order less PSA than their generalists colleagues. "],

Further steps", " Survival analysis of patients with multimorbidity treated by Family Physicians compared to those treated by Generalists with no vocational training in Family Medicine Introduction Residency training in Family Medicine is the gold standard for medical vocational training for Primary Care (PC) and it is expected that residents trained in certified residency programs perform better than untrained physicians when providing care for their patients, being more parsimonious in spending available resources, offering ready and easy access to care for their patients and expanding the scope of their practice by managing a wide range of prevalent health conditions [6]. By training young doctors for the practice of PC it is expected that they will not only develop technical skills making them ready to easily solve common health problems but also learning and incorporating the principles of Family Medicine [7], such as comprehensiveness, continuity of care and patient-centered care [8], into their practice. As Barbara Starfield’s widely known research [9] showed that having a health system strongly funded in the attributes of PC is not only good for the patients, but also for health systems and governments, since it is more efficient by a lower cost. There is a good agreement on how important it is to have a health system with strong PHC, but the way to build it and develop its attributes is still an open field for debate. If the reacently launched Astana Declaration [10] - and its 1978 predecessor Alma Ata Declaration [11] - clearly stated that primary care is the way to achieve Universal Health Coverage and Equity in Health, none of them mentioned Family Medicine as the most suitable medical spcialty to achieve their aims though. Beyond clinical skills to perform prevention, diagnostics, treatment and palliation, Family Physicians are trained to diagnose and treat some conditions beyond the biomedical spectrum, such as treatment adherence, emotional and mental burden, lack of social and family support or poor self-efficacy [12]. Combining all those domains in the practice of primary care - from biomedical knowledge and clinical reasoning to social, relational and communicational skills - is what makes Family Medicine so difficult to be well done and therefor, very hard to be investigated [13]. This is important for every patient at any level of care, but it is paramount for those patients with Multimorbidity where two or more chronic conditions coexist, leading to all sorts of combinations of symptoms, treatments, outcomes, impairments and doubts about the best way to address each one [14]. Treating only the biomedical aspects of the disease by strictly following therapeutic protocols patients with Multimorbidity are at risk of polypharmacy and serious adverse events, while probably will not have their illness and health demands seen and addressed. Vocational training in Family Medicine tries to promote a health care professional capable of dealing not only with commmon and prevalent health conditions (Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart Failure and Dementia) but also with the complexity that arises when several chronic conditions and personal singular expectations, disabilities and individual and social vulnerabilities coexist in the same patient [15]. For the reason stated above Multimorbidity will be the event of interest in this study that aims to answer the question “Do patients treated by trained family physicians live longer than those treated by physicians with no special training?”. Methodology In this preliminary study a Survival Analysis was performed comparing Generalists (medical primary care providers with no vocational training in Family Medicine) and Family Physicians (those who have been trained as - or are currently training to become - Family Physicians). The survival of patients with multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions in the same patient, was measured by the number of days between the day the patient was diagnosed as having the second chronic condition until the last day he/she was seen at the clinic (censoring) or until the day of death (outcome). Multimorbidity was cathegorized as having two or more chronic conditions chosen by the domains listed by the Charlson[3] and Elixhauser[4] Comorbidity Indexes, summarising 29 chronic health conditions. Eligible patients were those 18 years of age or older and those who had had at least two consultations at the PHC clinic during the period of January 2013 until December 2018. For this analysis we considered only those patients who were seen exclusively by Family Physicians (exposure) or by Generalists (control). Patients seen by both medical cathegories or had only one consultations were excluded from the analysis.

Forth model - Age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index and Medical specialty Finally when the information about the kind of physicians tyhat took care of the patient (Family Physician versus Generalists) the result was that if a patient is seen by a Fammily Physician there is a two times the chance of dying when compared to those patients seen by Generalists (HR 2.082 - 95% Ci 1.865; 2.325). That information contradicts what the theoretical model presented in the introduction, i.e., that Family Physicians would be more capable of providing better care for their patients, mainly for those with Multimorbidity. ## Call: ## survival::coxph(formula = surv_obj ~ sex + age + charlson + FP, ## data = amostra) ## ## n= 31086, number of events= 1753 ## (437 observations deleted due to missingness) ## ## coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) ## sexM 0.435744 1.546113 0.048196 9.041 &lt;2e-16 *** ## age 0.056113 1.057717 0.002064 27.189 &lt;2e-16 *** ## charlson 0.395633 1.485324 0.021196 18.666 &lt;2e-16 *** ## FP 0.733429 2.082208 0.056281 13.031 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 ## sexM 1.546 0.6468 1.407 1.699 ## age 1.058 0.9454 1.053 1.062 ## charlson 1.485 0.6733 1.425 1.548 ## FP 2.082 0.4803 1.865 2.325 ## ## Concordance= 0.728 (se = 0.007 ) ## Rsquare= 0.039 (max possible= 0.662 ) ## Likelihood ratio test= 1250 on 4 df, p=&lt;2e-16 ## Wald test = 1310 on 4 df, p=&lt;2e-16 ## Score (logrank) test = 1314 on 4 df, p=&lt;2e-16 ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_errorbar). The expected results for the last model would be “no difference” between the two groups. There are two main reasons for that. The first one was that several variables were not included in the model, such as individual, social and clinical differences among participants. The second reason was that it would be very unlikely - presumptious, at least - that 3 or 4 years of contact between patients and Family Physicians would make a difference in terms of longevity. Less blood tests, less drugs prescribed, less referals to secondary care and some hospital admissions avoided would be fairly expected, but regarding to longevity, if any difference would happened to exist between Generalists and Family Physicians, it would be small and probably with no statistical significance. However the results point towards the opposite direction, showing a big difference between the two groups in favor of Generalists. One short answer to that would be that Family Physicians are not treating their patients so well or maybe they are being neglectful and providing poorer quality care by prescribing less medications, requiring fewer blood tests, and refering less to secondary care services. That could be a reasonable answer, but the still we would see a small difference, probably with no statistical significance. The question that must be stated here is “why such a big difference between the two groups in favor of Generalists?”. This question must be addressed by exploring three different sources of errors in epidemiological studies: information bias, selection bias and confounding. Information Bias or Selection Bias: Which chronic conditions Primary Care doctors are taking care of in Rio de Janeiro? Differences in the prevalence of Chronic Health Conditions among patients treated by Family Physicians and Generalists in Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro. In order to explore the relationship of Primary Care Physicians (Generalists and Family Physicians) with some chronic conditions studied here, some logistic regression models were run, having the presence or absence of each condition as dependent variable and being a Family Physician or a Generalist as the main explanatory variable. This variable is a continuous linear variable ranging from 0 (every consultation with Generalist) to 1 (every consultation with Fammily Physicians). Intermediate values represent the proportion of consultations with FP, i.e. a patient with “0.83” means that 83% of the consultations were with FP. This happens due to the turnover of doctors at the PC clinics in Rio. In the sample studied here we have some Family Health Teams that started with Generalists in 2013 and before 2018 a Family Physician occupied the position. The idea here is to see if by being treated by a Family Physician a patient has a higher or lower chance of being diagnosed with each of the 29 chronic conditions of interest. Odds ratio to be diagnosed with a chronic condition In table 1 we can see the odds for a patient to be diagnosed with a specific chronic condition when treated by a Family Physician compared to patients treated by Generalists. Generalists are the reference and every odds ratio represent the increment or decrement for a patient to be diagnosed with that specific condition. Table 42: Table 1: Odds ratio for a patient to be diagnosed with a specific chronic condition when treated by a Family Physician compared to patients treated by Generalists (odds = 1) in Rio de Janeiro Diseases OR CI Hypertension 0.84 0.83 - 0.86 Complications related to Hypertension 0.97 0.88 - 1.06 Dyslipidemia 0.39 0.36 - 0.42 Diabetes without chronic complication 0.89 0.86 - 0.91 Diabetes with chronic complication 0.95 0.86 - 1.05 Peptic ulcer disease, excluding bleeding 1.21 0.9 - 1.61 Anemia 1.05 0.94 - 1.18 Alcohol abuse 2.49 2.22 - 2.8 Illicit drugs abuse 2.8 2.45 - 3.19 Psychosis 1.47 1.34 - 1.62 Depression 1.39 1.31 - 1.48 Hypothiroidism 1.25 1.16 - 1.35 Cardiac arrhythmias 1.61 1.45 - 1.77 Coagulopathy 1.23 0.92 - 1.63 Rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases 1.42 1.26 - 1.59 Other neurological disorders 1.22 1.12 - 1.33 Ischemic Heart Disease 1.97 1.73 - 2.25 Congestive Heart Failure 1.97 1.82 - 2.14 Peripheral vascular disorders 2.87 2.43 - 3.39 Cerebrovascular disease 1.63 1.5 - 1.76 Dementia 1.66 1.49 - 1.85 Chronic pulmonary disease 1.41 1.32 - 1.5 Paralysis 1.21 0.95 - 1.54 Renal failure 2.17 1.94 - 2.42 Lymphoma, Leukemia and Solid tumour without metastasis 1.69 1.56 - 1.83 Mild liver disease 1.42 1.23 - 1.62 Severe liver disease 1.64 1.01 - 2.61 Metastatic cancer 1.69 1.56 - 1.83 AIDS/HIV 1.59 1.44 - 1.76 The differences are very significant and point towards an interesting pattern: Diabetes, dyslipidemia or hypertension - the most prevalent chronic conditions in Rio de Janeiro - are more likely to be diagnosed by a Generalist, while not so common and somewhat more complex chronic conditions, i.e. Alcohol abuse, Psychosis, Congestive Heart Failure, Dementia and Renal failure, are way more likely to be diagnosed by Family Physicians. After finding those variations among Family Physicians and Generalists in making the diagnosis of several chronic conditions, age and sex were introduced in the models as the main risk factors for most of the conditions studied here. Adjusted for age and sex In table 2 we can see that the inclusion of those variables increase the effect for some conditions (Ischemic Heart Disease, Congestive Heart Failure and Peripheral vascular disorders) but derceased for others (AIDS/HIV and Illicit drugs abuse). Table 43: Table 2: Adjusted for age and sex odds ratio for a patient to be diagnosed with a specific chronic condition when treated by a Family Physician compared to patients treated by Generalists (odds = 1) in Rio de Janeiro Diseases OR CI Hypertension 0.85 0.83 - 0.87 Complications related to Hypertension 0.99 0.9 - 1.09 Dyslipidemia 0.39 0.35 - 0.42 Diabetes without chronic complication 1.22 0.9 - 1.62 Diabetes with chronic complication 0.9 0.88 - 0.93 Peptic ulcer disease, excluding bleeding 0.97 0.87 - 1.08 Anemia 1.09 0.97 - 1.21 Alcohol abuse 2.42 2.15 - 2.71 Illicit drugs abuse 2.61 2.29 - 2.96 Psychosis 1.46 1.33 - 1.6 Depression 1.44 1.36 - 1.54 Hypothiroidism 1.32 1.23 - 1.43 Cardiac arrhythmias 1.66 1.5 - 1.83 Coagulopathy 1.26 0.94 - 1.66 Rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases 1.48 1.31 - 1.67 Other neurological disorders 1.22 1.11 - 1.33 Ischemic Heart Disease 2.03 1.77 - 2.31 Congestive Heart Failure 2.07 1.91 - 2.25 Peripheral vascular disorders 3.02 2.55 - 3.58 Cerebrovascular disease 1.7 1.56 - 1.84 Dementia 1.74 1.56 - 1.95 Chronic pulmonary disease 1.44 1.35 - 1.54 Paralysis 1.21 0.94 - 1.53 Renal failure 2.26 2.01 - 2.53 Lymphoma, Leukemia and Solid tumour without metastasis 1.76 1.62 - 1.9 Mild liver disease 1.44 1.25 - 1.65 Severe liver disease 1.63 1 - 2.61 Metastatic cancer 1.76 1.62 - 1.9 AIDS/HIV 1.51 1.37 - 1.66 But still we see the same pattern in the likelihood of been diagnosed for a chronic condition - Generalists are more likely to diagnose those chronic conditions that are very prevalent, which have treaments based on protocols and which conform to federal policies for screening, diagnosis, treatment and survailance. Family Physicians, in the other hand, tend to diagnose more unprevalent and complex conditions showing a more comprehensive approach in terms of diagnosis. Poisson distribution Table 44: Table 3: Adjusted for age and sex odds ratio for a patient to be diagnosed with a specific chronic condition when treated by a Family Physician compared to patients treated by Generalists (odds = 1) in Rio de Janeiro - Poisson distribution Diseases OR CI Hypertension 0.91 0.89 - 0.92 Complications related to Hypertension 0.99 0.9 - 1.09 Dyslipidemia 0.39 0.36 - 0.43 Diabetes without chronic complication 0.92 0.89 - 0.94 Diabetes with chronic complication 0.97 0.88 - 1.08 Peptic ulcer disease, excluding bleeding 1.22 0.9 - 1.62 Anemia 1.09 0.97 - 1.21 Alcohol abuse 2.4 2.14 - 2.69 Illicit drugs abuse 2.59 2.28 - 2.95 Psychosis 1.46 1.33 - 1.6 Depression 1.43 1.35 - 1.52 Hypothiroidism 1.32 1.22 - 1.42 Cardiac arrhythmias 1.65 1.49 - 1.82 Coagulopathy 1.25 0.94 - 1.66 Rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases 1.48 1.31 - 1.67 Other neurological disorders 1.21 1.11 - 1.32 Ischemic Heart Disease 2.01 1.76 - 2.3 Congestive Heart Failure 2.04 1.88 - 2.21 Peripheral vascular disorders 3 2.53 - 3.55 Cerebrovascular disease 1.67 1.55 - 1.81 Dementia 1.69 1.51 - 1.89 Chronic pulmonary disease 1.43 1.34 - 1.53 Paralysis 1.21 0.94 - 1.53 Renal failure 2.24 1.99 - 2.5 Lymphoma, Leukemia and Solid tumour without metastasis 1.74 1.61 - 1.88 Mild liver disease 1.44 1.25 - 1.65 Severe liver disease 1.63 1 - 2.61 Metastatic cancer 1.74 1.61 - 1.88 AIDS/HIV 1.5 1.36 - 1.65 Using the Poisson distribution the models get better adjusted. In table 3 we can still see the same differences though. Common and simple chronic conditions are more likely to be diagnosed by Generalists, while uncommon and complex chronic conditions are more likely to be diagnosed by trained Family Physicians. This is an important aspect to be unveiled in the search for evidences of good practice in PC, given that physicians should comprehensively address all health problems that may arise and not only those determined by public policies such as diabetes, dyslipidemia or hypertension. The information highlighted here showing different patterns of diagnosis between Generalists and Family Physicians make a good hint that both Selection and Information bias are responsible for the extreme differences seen at the survival analysis. If the physician doesn’t see the problem, he/she won’t be able to make the diagnosis and, therefore, fulfill the respective ICD code at the patient’s EMR. Another posibility is that if the doctor see the problem and fill out the code in the EMR, he/she can refer the patient to secondary care, saying that, from now on, the patient will be followed by the specialist. In both situations those patients were not included in this cohort, since the inclusion criteria was “having at least two consultations in the primay care clinic”. In this case we would have both information bias, i.e. doctor doens’t see the problem and is unable to make the diagnosis, and selection bias, i.e. if the diagnosis is made, the patient is refered to secondary care and is no longer followed at the PC setting. The same situation is discussed in a research about avoidable hospital admissions regarding ambulatory-care sensitive conditions in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where having higher scores at the PCATool didn’t make much difference in the survival to the first hospital admission [16]. If the Family Physician is dealing with more complex patients, not ony low risk patients with high blood pressure, dyslypidemia and diabetes, their patients are more likely to die. Further steps Finish the linkage between EMRs and referals DB and then find the patients that were only seen once at the clinic. Finish the linkage between EMRs and hospital admissions DB and then perform a survival analysis having time to the first hospital admissions as main outcome. References "],
