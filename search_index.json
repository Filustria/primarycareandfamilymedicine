["intro.html", "Introduction Summary and Objectives Methodology Databases Population study and Exposure Description of the three articles References", " Introduction Summary and Objectives This is a longitudinal retrospective study with the main objective of measuring the impact and the cost-effectiveness of vocational training in Family Medicine as part of the capacity building policy for Primary Health Care (PHC) implemented in 2012 during the PHC reform that happened between 2009 to 2016 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Since 1994 Brazil has been experiencing a big reform in PHC and today almost 70% of the Brazilian population is covered by the Programa Saúde da Família (PSF - Family Health Program). This Federal policy stablishes a structure for PHC at the municipal level, providing financial resources for a Family Health Team (ESF - Equipe de Saúde da Família) formed by one Physician, one Nurse and 4 to 6 Community Health Agents to take care of 4000 people living inside a catchment area. Rio de Janeiro was the last Brazilian capital to embrace the PSF. A PHC reform took place in the city between 2008 and 2016 and during this period the coverage increased from only 3.5% to 70%. 1400 Family Health Teams are currently working in the city, providing care for more than 3.5 million people in a system that merges public funding with private non-for-profit organizations responsible for management, care delivery and for structural and human resources. In 2012 the Health Department started a strategy for human resources capacity building in Family Medicine signing a partnership with the two Family Medicine residency programs stablished at that time in the city and also launching a new residency program. The strategy not only expanded the number of residency vacancies (210 vacancies in 2018) in Family Medicine (FM), but also included a financial incentive for both preceptors and residents, making FM more attractive to doctors seeking a specialization. This strategy aimed not only at capacity building of human resources, but also at provision and fixation of doctors in Primary Care Clinics in Rio de Janeiro. Despite the recent efforts of the Rio de Janeiro health department to make Primary Care more effective – establishing new clinics, improving working conditions and training new specialists – they were not enough to change policy makers mindset about the importance of PC and the need for professional training. Common generalizations still prevail among them, perpetuating wrong notions such as no need for specific training, other than medical graduation, to work in PC. This initiative ended up creating a natural experiment in the city. Some clinics now have only Family Physicians as medical health care providers, some have different combinations of trained Family Physicians and generalists and some have no trained doctors at all. In this scenario, there is a clear difference in access to health care and in the way patients are treated that is due to the amount of training received. These differences weren’t measured until now and “what is the actual difference?” – i.e., the real effect that having specific medical training focused on PC – it is an important question to be addressed, especially for countries with young PHC systems. The main objective of this thesis is to assess the impact on health outcomes of Family Medicine training provided by residency programs and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the investment made. Methodology Databases This research is composed by a cohort of patients registered and attended at the PHC clinics in the Rio de Janeiro municipality. The study will use data from (1) the electronic medical records (EMR) to conform the study population between the years 2010 and 2018, (2) data from the National Registry of Health Establishments (CNES) between the years 2010 and 2018, (3) data from the Mortality Information System (SIM) between 2000 and 2018, (4) data on referrals requested for patients to Secondary Care between 2010 and 2018 (SISREG platform); and (5) data from the Hospital Admissions National System (SISAIH) between 2008 and 2018, which compiles the information on hospital admissions through the registration of the Hospital Admission Authorizations (AIH). These five databases will be merged using a linkage process via with RecordLinkage and fastLink packages in R. Population study and Exposure The reference population for this study will be composed of the patients enrolled in the Primary Care clinics. Patients who have consulted in this period, but who are not registered in the health units will also be counted as the base population. The exposures of interest in the study are the medical professionals providing care to this population, representing different levels of training, i.e., (1) Generalists providing PC, with no special training; (2) generalists linked to the “Programa Mais Médicos” (PMM), a Federal policy for provision and fixation of doctors in remote areas; (3) trained Family Physicians; (4) Preceptors in Family Medicine; and (5) Residents in Family Medicine. Each of these five groups of professionals is linked to the service under a different employment regime, receiving different salaries, from different paying sources and with different financial incentives, conforming five different forms of medical work in PHC. These characteristics can be seen in the table below: Profissional Salary Bonus Funding source Workload (hours/week) Continuing Medical Education Generalist R$ 15.000,00 + taxes no bonus Public funded, managed by private non-for-profit institution 40 Seldom, addresing PH needs PMM R$ 10.000,00 (schoolarship) no bonus Federal government 32 Once a month by a FP FM resident R$ 3.300,00 (federal schoolarship)\" R$ 7.594,32 (municipal schoolarship) Federal &amp; Municipal entities 55 intensive Family Physician R$ 15.000,00 + taxes R$ 2.500 for trained FP Public funded, managed by private non-for-profit institution 40 Seldom, addresing PHC needs Preceptor in Family Medicine R$ 15.000,00 + taxes R$ 2.500 (trained FP) + R$ 2500 (preceptorship) Public funded, managed by private non-for-profit institution 40 intensive The five groups will be summarized into two main categories - Family Physicians (FP) and non-Family Physicians (generalists) and every Family Health Care Team (ESF) will be assigned as having one of the two categories. The original division is necessary to compute the cost-effectiveness analysis that will be held later. The outcomes that will be studied will result in three different articles, each of them addressing a distinct FMdomain of practice. Description of the three articles Ambulatory-Care Sensitive Conditions Longitudinal analysis through a Panel Data study, comparing FP to generalists for the measurement of outcomes related to the Brazilian list of Ambulatory-Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) [1]. This list comprises 20 domains covering infectious conditions (pneumonia and bacterial infections), chronic health problems (angina, heart failure) and preventive health care procedures (prenatal care), providing a good framework to approach the FM broad scope of practice. Rates of hospital admissions, referrals to secondary care, drugs prescribed, and laboratory exams ordered will be measured for every ESF. The Incidence Rate Ratio will be calculated between the two categories, estimating the interventions avoided (hospital admissions, referrals, drugs prescription and labs ordered) and, finally, the expenses avoided by FP in comparison to generalists. The unit of analysis will be the rate of each intervention by every ESF to those patients attended for ACSC. For the Economic Analysis, this study will measure the cost for avoiding the interventions mentioned above for those patients attended for ACSC. Comprehensive care for patients with multimorbidity Survival analysis of patients with Multimorbidity treated by FP versus generalists. Multimorbidity, defined as the occurrence of two or more chronic conditions in the same patient, will be measured for every patient attended at the PC clinics and time to event will be measured from the moment the patient fits the definition of Multimorbidity to the occurrence of two outcomes: death from any cause and first hospital admission. A longitudinal analysis using a Cox regression model to estimate the survival of multimorbid patients followed in Rio de Janeiro’s Primary Care, comparing patients treated by FP to generalists. The Charlson Index for comorbidity will be used to adjust the model, allowing patients with different burden of diseases to be compared. A Cost-effectiveness analysis will measure DALYs averted among multimorbid patients treated by FP compared to generalists. Survival of patients at cardiovascular risk Survival analysis comparing trained FP to generalists when dealing with patients at risk for cardiovascular outcomes. Patients older than 55 years-old with a cardiovascular risk greater than 10% in 10 years, according to the Framingham score, will be included in the study and time to event will be measured. A longitudinal analysis using a Cox regression model to estimate the survival for those patients treated at the Rio de Janeiro’s PHC System, comparing patients treated by FP to generalists. Individual cardiovascular risk will be used to adjust the model the same way the Charlson Index for comorbidity, allowing comparisons between patients with different burden of diseases. The events of interest are the main outcomes related to cardiovascular morbimortality, i.e., myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, coronary revascularization, claudication, and CHD and non-CHD mortality. A Cost-effectiveness analysis will measure DALYs averted among patients treated by treated by FP compared to generalists. References References "],

The diseases were selected from the Charlson [2] and Elixhauser [3] Comorbidities indexes since they are the two main indexes studied in the literature related to in-patient deaths. Each index has its own set of conditions and weights. The sets of conditions were taken from the orginial articles [2,3] where they were first published and from the Comorbidity R package article [4], where the author uses the same set of ICD-10 codes to build the indexes. Each chronic condition will be presented here with its prevalence in the population studied and stratified by age and sex. The DT library will be used to present the data and at the end of this chapter information about Multimorbidity is presented. Population description In this study only patients that have had at least one medical consultation during the period studied were counted.

Therefore, it is more likely that PC doctors miss to code this conditions in the patient’s EMR.

["blood-tests-ordered-in-primary-care-in-rio-de-janeiro.html", "Blood tests ordered in Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro HEMOGRAM CREATININE UREA URIC ACID The Cholesterol Combo Glicose and A1C Hemoglobin URINE ANALYSIS The Thyroid Combo - TSH, T4, T4 and Free - T4 PSA for Prostate Cancer Screening", " Blood tests ordered in Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro This analysis aims to identify patterns of physicians clinical behaviour regarding some blood test commonly ordered by doctors dealing with ambulatory patients in Primary Care. The period of analysis comprises every medical consultation in ambulatory care from January 1st, 2013 to November 1st, 2018 made by every doctors that work (or worked) in one of the 30 Primary Care Clinics at the ‘AP 31’ district in Rio de Janeiro. The total number of consultations was 2.967.694 during the period of analysis, that is the same period of the inclusion of the Eletronic Medical Records in the city. The total number of doctors that worked in the area is 952: 208 (21.8%) of them trained Family Physicians or residents in Family Medicine and 744 (78.2%) doctors with no special training for Primary Care, some of them with training in another residency (Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, OB/GYN). These doctors will be called ‘Generalists’ in this report. The rates were calculated for every doctor by dividing the number of each test ordered by the number of consultations made during a month. For comparison, the average rate was calculated for Family Physicians and Generalists. The blood tests chose for the sake of comparison are very common laboratory exams ordered in Primary Care and are sensitive for interventions aiming best practices in ambulatory care and special training in Family Medicine. The rationale for this study is that financial and institutional investments made in the last years to promote Family Medicine as the medical specialty for Primary Care in Rio de Janeiro should show some results such as better health outcomes, better care delivered for the patients and better use of healh resources available. In this study we will focus on blood tests as a resource that must be rationaly used by the health care provider and the hypothesis is that Family Physicians, due to their special training, order less blood tests then Generalists. HEMOGRAM One of the most commonly ordered tests in Primary Care (PC). Physicians tend to order it if they need to order any other blood test, even if no information is required from this exam. ## Warning: Detecting old grouped_df format, replacing `vars` attribute by ## `groups` CREATININE Blood test commonly ordered for patients with suspition of Renal Failure and for patients at risk for cardiovascular events, such as those with Hypertension and Diabetes. UREA Blood test commonly ordered for hospitalized patients and for those with Renal Failure as a secondary test to identify the origin of the renal disease. For patients in PC two conditions are likely to have this test ordered: Renal Failure and Heart Failure - two conditions not so prevalent in PC. For patients with Hypertension and Diabetes this test add no help to their treatment. URIC ACID This blood test is specific for patients with (or suspition of) gout arthritis. Due to the fact that patients with end-stage kidney disease have a higher risk of death when their Uric Acid levels are high, some doctors use to order this test for every patient at risk for cardiovascular disease, even if it is not helpful for patients with no renal demage. The Cholesterol Combo This combo is usualy ordered for patients at risk for cardiovascular events. Since the advent of cholesterol as one of the main responsible for heart attack and stroke, it is offered for almost every patient older than 45. All graphs but LDL Cholesterol show no difference between Family Physicians and Generalist. This only difference show that Family Physicians are more familiar with the formula used by the laboratories to calculate the LDL share of the Total Cholesterol. With this simple formula is posible to order only three test (Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol and Triglycerids) to find the value for LDL Cholesterol. Glicose and A1C Hemoglobin This tests are among the most ordered exams in Primary Care. They usually are ordered for two reasons related to Diabetes and glucose metabolism problems. Glucose is the first exam ordered to diagnose Diabetes - two tests higher than 126 mg/dL makes the diagnosis. After a patient is diagnosed with Diabetes the condition is managed with hypoglicemic measures (diet, weight loss, exercises and some medications) and the patients A1C hemoglobin must be checked every 6 months - in some cases doctors can do it in a shorter lag. In the glucose graph pregnant woman must be taken from the analysis, since this test is part of the pre-natal care protocol. URINE ANALYSIS The Thyroid Combo - TSH, T4, T4 and Free - T4 Thyroid problems are commom problems in Primary Care, especially Hypothiroidsm, which affects *** patients. Three problems occur with this tests. The first one is the “combo” issue. During graduation young doctors usually learn that, when it is needed to investigate any Thyroid gland problem, it must be done by ordering the full “combo” of exams. For the most common thyroid problems though, TSH provides enough information about the gland. The second problem is the “follow up” issue. Patients with Hypothyroidism (the most frequent thyroid disease) have lower levels of THS and need to take medications for hormone replacement. At the time of the diagnosis TSH levels are usually high (that makes the diagnosis) and with the hormonal replacement those levels must come back to the normal range (0.4 - 4 mg/dL). Therefore, there must be a dose adjustment by checking the TSH levels after some weeks of treatment. At this moment, the “combo” is ordered and three useless tests are performed. The third problem is related to clinical reasoning skills to deal with patients with undiferentiated symptoms in Primary Care and it explains the differences between the rates. During graduation medical students learn that thyroid gland problems can produce a vast and vague spectrum of symptoms. During the Family Medicine training doctors learn comunication skills and patient centered clinical methods that help them to solve some of this diagnostic challenges, avoiding unnecessary TSH tests. With no special training it is hard to approach patients ideas, concerns and expectations about their illness and easily a generalist will follow the line learnt at medical school: “If you don’t know what your patient has, check the thyroid gland”. In the T3, T4 and Free-T4 graphs what is shown is not a behavioural change among generalist, but a prohibition from the Municipal Department of Health for Primary Care physicians to order this tests without consent from the medical director of the clinic. Even with this vertical intervention, Family Physicians still order less PSA than their generalists colleagues. PSA for Prostate Cancer Screening Prostate Cancer Screening is a big public health and political issue. Media and medical specialties insist on calling adult men to perform this test as an anual “check-up”, advising them that this “frequent” cancer is treatable and deaths by prostate cancer are avoidable. Public health experts and evidence based physicians advocate against this test, telling men to avoid it, showing the consequences of overdiagnosis. Family Medicine is one of the medical specialties concerned with having good evidence to offer any procedure for their patients. In the graph what is shown is not a behavioural change among generalist, but a prohibition from the Municipal Department of Health for Primary Care physicians to order this tests without consent from the medical director of the clinic. Even with this vertical intervention, Family Physicians still order less PSA than their generalists colleagues. "],
